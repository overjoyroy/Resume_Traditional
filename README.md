# academic_cv_latex

This repository contains my academic CV written in **LaTeX**. I use **Overleaf** for all my LaTeX editing to avoid installing LaTeX on my local machine.

I'm storing my academic CV on GitHub for two reasons:

1. In case the University of Pittsburgh revokes my credentials, preventing me from retrieving my documents.
2. To allow others to view and replicate their own CVs based on mine if they find it helpful.

To use, simply **drag and drop** these files into Overleaf (the `README.md` file is not required).
