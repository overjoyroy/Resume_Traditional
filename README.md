# Traditional Resume in Latex

This repository contains my resume written in **LaTeX**. I use **Overleaf** for all my LaTeX editing to avoid installing LaTeX on my local machine.

I'm storing my resume on GitHub for two reasons:

1. In case the University of Pittsburgh revokes my credentials, preventing me from retrieving my documents.
2. To allow others to view and replicate their own resumes based on mine if they find it helpful.

To use, simply **drag and drop** these files into Overleaf (the `README.md` file is not required).
