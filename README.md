# Traditional Resume in LaTeX

This repository contains my resume written in **LaTeX**. I use **Overleaf** for all my LaTeX editing to avoid installing LaTeX on my local machine.

I'm storing my resume on **GitHub** for two reasons:

1. In case the University of Pittsburgh revokes my credentials, preventing me from accessing my documents.
2. To allow others to view and replicate their own resumes based on mine if they find it helpful.

### üìÑ Viewing My Resume  
You can view the latest version of my resume here: [Resume.pdf](https://joyroy.org/files/Resume.pdf).  

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** The code in this repository may not always match the compiled PDF since I do not have the premium version of Overleaf and must manually push updates.

### üîß How to Use  
To use this template, simply **drag and drop** these files into Overleaf (the `README.md` file is not required).
